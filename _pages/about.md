Hi there! I'm Eunju Park. I am passionate about artificial intelligence and its potential to bridge the gap between modalities, enabling machines to understand and interact with the world more intuitively. My research interests include <Strong>Multimodal Learning, Anomaly Detection, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Generative Models</Strong>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewha/index.do) and am preparing to enter graduate school in the second half of 2025.
